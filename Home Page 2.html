            <p style='color: black; font-size: 25px;'>The <strong>Pandan</strong> has immense cultural and economic importance in the <strong>Philippines</strong> and its various indigenous groups. It is also known as <strong>Pandanus amaryllifolius</strong>, a tropical plant widely used in <strong>Southeast Asian</strong> cuisine for its unique flavor and aroma. It is commonly found in <strong>Thailand</strong>, <strong>Indonesia</strong>,<strong> Malaysia</strong>, and the <strong>Philippines</strong>. The plant has been integral to traditional cooking and cultural practices in these regions for centuries. </p>

            <p style='color: black; font-size: 25px; '>There are about <strong>700</strong> known species of the <strong>Pandanus</strong>. It is a <strong>monocots genus</strong> from the <strong>screwpine family</strong>, the <u>Pandanaceae</u>. The Pandanus varies in size from shrub to tree, and its height will depend on its height. The trunk of the Pandan bears prop roots, and its leaves are spirally crowded toward the ends of the branches. The leaves are elongated and slender, measuring up to one and a half meters long and three to five centimeters wide. It also has sharp spiny teeth on its leaves.
            </p>
             ">WHAT IS PANDAN?</button>
            <button style= "font-weight: bold;"class="interactive-button" data-text="
            <p style='color: black; font-size: 25px;'> The pandan plant is believed to have originated in <strong>Southern Asia</strong>, particularly in the <strong>Indian</strong> subcontinent. It is said to have been introduced to Southeast Asia through trade and cultural exchanges between India and the Malay Archipelago. Indian merchants traveling through the region brought various plants, including pandan, which soon became naturalized in Southeast Asian countries.</p>
            ">HISTORICAL BACKGROUND OF PANDAN</button>
            <button style= "font-weight: bold;"class="interactive-button" data-text="
            <p style='color: black; font-size: 25px;'>The <em><strong>Batak</strong></em> are one of the approximately <u>140 Indigenous groups</u> in the <strong>Philippines</strong>. They inhabit the northeastern parts of <strong>Palawan</strong>, a large island in the archipelago's southwestern region. The <em><strong>Batak</strong></em> are particularly known for appreciating two species of wild Panda: <strong>barisan</strong> and <strong>banking</strong>. When selecting land for cultivation, they use criteria based on the surrounding plants and the soil characteristics.</p>

            <p style='color: black; font-size: 25px;'>Other than as a tree indicator, the <em><strong>Batak</strong></em> values the Pandanus for its leaves, which are used in <u>weaving sleeping mats, baskets</u>, and <u>multi-purpose containers</u>. Pandan holds great cultural significance in Southeast Asian societies. In many countries, the plant is considered <strong>sacred</strong> and is used in <strong>religious rituals</strong> and <strong>ceremonies</strong>. The <strong>leaves</strong> are often used as <u>offerings</u> in <u>temples</u> and <u>shrines</u>, symbolizing <strong>blessings</strong> and <strong>good fortune.</strong>
            </p>
            
            <p style='color: black; font-size: 25px;'>Furthermore, pandan is used in <strong>traditional aromatherapy</strong> and <strong>natural dyeing practices</strong>. The plant’s distinct aroma is believed to have a calming effect on the mind and body, making it a popular choice for essential oils and incense. In addition, the leaves can be used to extract a natural green dye commonly used in traditional textiles.

            ">CULTURAL SIGNIFICANCE OF PANDAN</button>
            <button style= "font-weight: bold;"class="interactive-button" data-text="
            <p style='color: black; font-size: 25px;'> There are <u>different uses</u> for <strong>pandan</strong>, also known as <strong>screw pine</strong>, depending on its form, whether leaves, paste, extract, or powder. <strong>Whole pandan leaves</strong> are used as a <u>wrapping</u> before steaming or frying foods, similar to banana leaves. Furthermore, <strong>Fibers</strong> found in <strong>Pandan leaves</strong> are proven to be ideal in <u>making handicrafts</u> such as bags, wallets, planters, mats, baskets, and other similar products.</p>
